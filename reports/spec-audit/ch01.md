1) Scope covered
- Audited `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` prologue/title + Chapter 1 sections 1.1–1.5 (lines 3–155).

2) Verified claims
- Repo is project-config driven with two active project definitions (`ovarian-platinum`, `lung-stage`) in YAML (`config/projects.yaml:107-175`).
- Few-shot patch classification uses LogisticRegression on patch embeddings (`src/enso_atlas/api/main.py:6825-6884`).
- Outlier detection is centroid-distance based (`src/enso_atlas/api/main.py:6958-6990`).
- Project-scoped model metadata endpoint exists (`src/enso_atlas/api/project_routes.py:564-595`).

3) Outdated/incorrect claims (with evidence file:line)
- **Claim:** foundation models are swappable via YAML only; no code changes needed (`TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md:56`, `65`).
  - **Mismatch:** embedder/model loading is hardcoded to Path Foundation in code.
  - **Evidence:** `src/enso_atlas/embedding/embedder.py:69` (hardcoded `model_id = "google/path-foundation"`), `src/enso_atlas/api/main.py:1211-1212` (always instantiates `PathFoundationEmbedder`), `src/enso_atlas/api/main.py:5625-5650` and `6141-6162` (Path Foundation-specific embedding pipeline).

- **Claim:** pluggable MIL includes TransMIL, CLAM, ABMIL (`TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md:57`, `66`, `144`).
  - **Mismatch:** only CLAM and TransMIL are implemented/selectable.
  - **Evidence:** `src/enso_atlas/mil/clam.py:878-889` (`create_classifier` supports only `clam`/`transmil`), `src/enso_atlas/mil/__init__.py:3` (exports only CLAM/TransMIL).

- **Claim:** no hardcoded cancer/model IDs in frontend (`TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md:60`).
  - **Mismatch:** frontend repo still contains hardcoded model IDs in demo/check files.
  - **Evidence:** `frontend/src/components/demo/mockData.ts:128-161` (`tumor_grade` hardcoded), `frontend/scripts/check-project-model-scoping.mjs:37-40` (hardcoded ovarian model IDs in checks).

- **Claim:** per-project feature toggles can enable/disable report/semantic features independently (`TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md:59`, `68`).
  - **Mismatch:** feature flags are defined in YAML but not consistently enforced in backend endpoints.
  - **Evidence:** `config/projects.yaml:138-141`, `171-174` (feature toggles defined), but `/api/report` path has no feature-flag gate (`src/enso_atlas/api/main.py:3080-3097`) and `/api/semantic-search` has no project feature check (`src/enso_atlas/api/main.py:4392-4404`).

- **Claim:** no cloud dependencies at runtime (`TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md:78`).
  - **Mismatch:** model loading can use network when cache is missing.
  - **Evidence:** `src/enso_atlas/embedding/embedder.py:73-90` (`local_files_only=False` unless cache/offline flags are set, then `from_pretrained(...)` is called).

4) Exact suggested edits (old snippet -> new snippet)
- **Old:** "Foundation models are config-driven... replaced ... by editing a YAML file... All downstream components ... adapt automatically..."
  ->
  **New:** "Foundation model metadata is config-defined, but this repo currently executes Path Foundation-specific embedding code paths. Swapping to a different backbone currently requires code integration plus config updates."

- **Old:** "Any attention-based MIL variant (TransMIL, CLAM, ABMIL) can be registered..."
  ->
  **New:** "Current implementation supports TransMIL and CLAM. Additional MIL variants (e.g., ABMIL) require implementation before registration."

- **Old:** "No hardcoded cancer types or model IDs exist in the frontend."
  ->
  **New:** "Runtime project/model selection is config-driven; however, demo/test frontend files still include hardcoded example model IDs."

- **Old:** "Feature toggles are per-project... can be enabled or disabled independently..."
  ->
  **New:** "Feature toggles are defined per project in config; backend enforcement is partial and should be treated as in-progress."

- **Old:** "On-Premise by Design: ... no cloud dependencies at runtime..."
  ->
  **New:** "On-prem deployment is supported; fully air-gapped operation requires pre-cached/local model artifacts (otherwise first-load may attempt remote model fetches)."

5) PASS/FAIL summary
- **FAIL** for Chapter 1 (prologue + sections 1.1–1.5): several architectural claims overstate current implementation (foundation-model swap mechanism, ABMIL support, feature-flag enforcement, frontend hardcoding, and runtime cloud dependency behavior).
